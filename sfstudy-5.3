1.Some pods are constantly terminating and restarting
The problem has been resolved, there are three issues in customer environment.
    /var/log do not have enough space, only 2G. This caused image-manager cannot write log and start failed. This is resolved after removing some large log files.
    There is a docker bug, which caused kubelet create container failed, and the only solution provided by Kubernetes community is restart the whole server.
    They did not mount the /var/lib/registry correctly, after re-create the image-manger, everything come back.
 
 I think that I misunderstood the item 2 you asked this morning. This misunderstanding was caused by 2 different ways of Docker installing in an ICP environment.
Case 1.
If a user installed an individual docker image on his environment, all technical supports including troubleshooting and fix patch are docker software company's responsibility.
Case 2.
If a user installed IBM Cloud Private Docker Package, obviously ICP support team should be responsible for troubleshooting, but requesting fix patch will be transferred to docker software company.
If your customer installed the Docker package, then all requests of fix patch for the package will be transferred to the Docker company via ICP Development team.
As Gung Ya confirmed during the troubleshooting, this issue has already been reported to Development team. I will keep you updated as soon as any progress on Dev side.
