1.Some pods are constantly terminating and restarting
The problem has been resolved, there are three issues in customer environment.
    /var/log do not have enough space, only 2G. This caused image-manager cannot write log and start failed. This is resolved after removing some large log files.
    There is a docker bug, which caused kubelet create container failed, and the only solution provided by Kubernetes community is restart the whole server.
    They did not mount the /var/lib/registry correctly, after re-create the image-manger, everything come back.
 
 I think that I misunderstood the item 2 you asked this morning. This misunderstanding was caused by 2 different ways of Docker installing in an ICP environment.
Case 1.
If a user installed an individual docker image on his environment, all technical supports including troubleshooting and fix patch are docker software company's responsibility.
Case 2.
If a user installed IBM Cloud Private Docker Package, obviously ICP support team should be responsible for troubleshooting, but requesting fix patch will be transferred to docker software company.
If your customer installed the Docker package, then all requests of fix patch for the package will be transferred to the Docker company via ICP Development team.
As Gung Ya confirmed during the troubleshooting, this issue has already been reported to Development team. I will keep you updated as soon as any progress on Dev side.   
    
This is the official documentation regarding How to support a open source related product in IBM.
If a critical defect is found in the open source software within IBM Cloud Private, IBM will leverage both IBM and open source community resources to deliver a fix to the problem. The resulting fix would be integrated, tested, and released to our clients as an emergency update or in the next release. If no fix is available from the community, IBM will use reasonable commercial efforts to provide a test fix and work with the specific open source community for an official fix. The final arbiter over whether a supported fix can be provided may belong to the open source community. If any enterprise-level open source project ever has a critical defect, many clients will be affected and the community will resolve it as fast as possible. Meaning, there will very rarely be an occurrence where only 1 customer will have a critical open source defect that is not affecting many other companies using the same open source.
As I updated yesterday, Dev team has already created a ticket to leverage both IBM resource and docker community. The ticket will log all communications between IBM and Decker in order to build up a patch for this case.
I will keep you updated as soon as any feedback from the Dev.
Please advise me if you have questions or concerns.
