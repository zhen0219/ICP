--2.1 Important: The boot, master, proxy, VA, and management nodes in your cluster must use the same platform architecture. Only the worker nodes can use a different platform architecture. 
Management console runs on master nodes only. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.3 and 7.4   
Location	Minimumdiskspace	  Node
/var/lib/docker	>40 GB	All Nodes   /var/lib/etcd	>1 GB	Master
/var/lib/registry	Must be large enough to host the Docker images that you plan to host in your private image registry	Master
/opt/ibm/cfc/	>100 GB	 Master and Management
/var/lib/kubelet	>10 GB	All Nodes need >10 GB of disk space
If you enable the Vulnerability Advisor, the VA node needs >100 GB of disk space. /var/lib/icp/va/	>100 GB	VA node
Important: The /var directory is the default storage location for most Docker images and the containers that are used in your IBM Cloud Private cluster.
