Hi All,
 
I am collecting valuable training materials, which is accumulated as ICP workload goes on. If you have any suggestion, please do let me know.
 
Regards,
Zhao
 
 
1) support tools by Arash

  We have a tool set (ICP Problem Determination Tool), that you can use to collect logs. Here is an internal link:
  https://github.ibm.com/IBMPrivateCloud/support-tools
 
2) training sessions orgnized by Rachid Boukhari El  
   This recording is also uploaded in the playback folder: https://ibm.ent.box.com/folder/45109999876 ? However only Xiaodong Can access this folder.
   Another way is to retrieve the info from Rachid's WebMeeting Record, all related info is recorded as below.

3) review github issue logged by support engineers
 
   You can use following URL to retrieve all github issues by individual engineer. Here we uses shfxing as an example.
   https://github.ibm.com/IBMPrivateCloud/roadmap/issues/created_by/shfxing
   Filter is " is:open is:issue author:shfxing " or " is:closed is:issue author:shfxing "

--2.1 Important: The boot, master, proxy, VA, and management nodes in your cluster must use the same platform architecture. Only the worker nodes can use a different platform architecture. 
Management console runs on master nodes only. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.3 and 7.4   
Location	Minimumdiskspace	  Node
/var/lib/docker	>40 GB	All Nodes   /var/lib/etcd	>1 GB	Master
/var/lib/registry	Must be large enough to host the Docker images that you plan to host in your private image registry	Master
/opt/ibm/cfc/	>100 GB	 Master and Management
/var/lib/kubelet	>10 GB	All Nodes need >10 GB of disk space
If you enable the Vulnerability Advisor, the VA node needs >100 GB of disk space. /var/lib/icp/va/	>100 GB	VA node
Important: The /var directory is the default storage location for most Docker images and the containers that are used in your IBM Cloud Private cluster.

--2.2 Versions of Docker that are supported by IBM Cloud Private
